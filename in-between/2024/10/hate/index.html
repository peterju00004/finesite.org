                <p>
                    A conversation happened at the airport with my friend. I recalled saying "[they are] just someone that I probably wouldn't contact ever in my life anyways" when commenting on a particular person. My friend responded, "I mean nothing is set in stone..." To which I replied, "But I do think that's something I would do."
                    <br><br>
                    Plenty instances like this exist, most remaining as unspoken thoughts in my mind. Acknowledging what one hates is remarkably challenging, and the reason somehow connects to the observation of our personas mentioned in my first article. Such admission resembles removing the attire we wear as protection and establishing our genuine thoughts on certain issues. Consequently, people naturally tend to blur their stance and opinions on particular matters, resulting in declarations of "no comment."
                    <br><br>
                    I used to say "no comment" frequently, though rarely now. Yet saying "no comment" is, to some extent, a form of commenting—just as deciding not to make a choice constitutes making a choice after all. Sometimes maintaining a neutral position inadvertently reveals much about our underlying subjective interpretations. Conversely, commenting on topics directly and unreservedly risks being perceived as slander. Since we all exist under observation of what we present—our personas—we sometimes find ourselves without the option to avoid commenting. Reflecting on this, perhaps admitting what one hates and acknowledging that others might hate oneself both require courage: perhaps similar to expression itself, and perhaps that's simply the nature of things.
                    <br><br>
                    Similar to revealing one's musical preferences publicly, exposing personal views in various circumstances across different platforms never comes easily. The subtle distinction between the so-called modern, western, mainstream unapologetic expression of genuine thoughts and outright slander depends on subjective intentions—as if making everything transparent and wearing the emperor's flamboyant new clothes in the parade is preferable to disparaging someone in darkness. Perhaps this represents one benefit of metaphorical nakedness.
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately, judgment of these behaviors relates to majority opinion. This isn't suggesting the majority is always correct: rather, it concerns this particular choice of exposure that seemed niche years ago but now flourishes online. This might represent evolution from nicheness to mainstream—from an excessively considerate attitude toward our environment and surroundings to a deeply analytical approach toward our ideas, subsequently sharing them with others.
                    <br><br>
                    As numerous celebrities demonstrate support for such openness, people tend to emulate this in daily life; alternatively, they might observe what certain groups pursue and willingly join them. Perhaps in this scenario, what's niche becomes popular, what's praised becomes despised, what's conservative becomes progressive. And this might embody creative destruction.
                    <br><br>
                    Whenever we choose, we eliminate possibilities of alternative directions. When we create something, we destroy its potential to become something else. Thus, as creators, we simultaneously function as destroyers. This perspective might apply to career development, as committing to one job means foregoing another. Therefore, the hesitant, passive, and traditional approaches become diverse and inclusive, while the progressive and active becomes monotonous. Perhaps therein lies the rationale for occupying middle ground, declaring "no comment," and refraining from expressions of hate.
