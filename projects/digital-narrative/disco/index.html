                <h3>DISCO Experience</h3>

                <h4 class="handwriting-small">Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    Over twelve weeks, I coordinated and conducted user testing for the Design an Inclusive Spaceship Collaborative Operation (DISCO) project. As a User Testing Coordinator & Research Assistant, I conducted early-stage research, managed outreach to disability organizations, facilitated co-design sessions, and consolidated feedback into actionable design improvements. This narrative shows the research, coordination, and facilitation skills I applied to the project.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h4 class="handwriting-small">Context and Challenge</h4>
                <p>
                    The DISCO project aimed to create an Open Educational Resource toolkit to teach inclusive design principles. While the concept itself is really engaging, we need authentic input from people with disabilities to ensure accessibility and relevance. My challenge was to recruit and coordinate diverse participants, design and manage the co-deign process, and deliver the insights that would refine toolkit elements, using the accessible communication strategies and co-design ethics.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h4 class="handwriting-small">My Role and Responsibilities</h4>
                <p>
                    As <b>User Testing Coordinator & Research Assistant</b>, I:
                    <ul class="paragraph-list">
                        <li>Conducted foundational research on co-design methodologies/ethics and accessibility best practices.</li>
                        <li>Identified and partnered with disability organizations, mapping potential collaborators and tracking outreach statuses.</li>
                        <li>Design accessible communications including email templates and informational guides for participants.</li>
                        <li>Facilitated co-design sessions, both remote and in-person, guiding participants through toolkit designs and taking note of their feedback.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h4 class="handwriting-small">Process and Approach</h4>
                <h5>Research and Planning</h5>
                <p>
                    In the initial weeks, I and my teammates conducted research to ensure our co-design sessions, as well as our website and our general communication, were inclusive and effective, I:
                    <ul class="paragraph-list">
                        <li>Explored plain-language guidelines to write outreach emails and session scripts.</li>
                        <li>Completed IRB training modules to conduct ethical research with human participants.</li>
                        <li>Reviewed the ethics of co-design.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Outreach and Recruitment</h5>
                <p>
                    With the research insights, I drafted an accessible outreach email template, iterated it based on Dr. Fitz and Lynn's feedback, and launched our campaign to eight Pittsburgh organizations. I tracked response in a custom spreadsheet with statuses from "Not sent" to "Confirmed," and followed up to include our scheudling Google form link properly. This approach helped engage five organizations.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Co-Design and Testing</h4>
                <p>
                    Between March 25th and 28th, I coordinated two co-design sessions. One of them is a remote session facilitated via Google Meet. The other one is in-person, held at Hillman Library at the University of Pittsburgh. During the two co-design sessions, participants created persona sketches and brainstorming while I documented the input.
                    <br>
                    For our website's Figma prototype, we collaborated with the UXD Club at Pitt for gaining insight on our website design. I, after collected their feedback, consolidated the statistics into actionable changes to make the website easier to navigate throught, enhancing the user experience.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Playtesting and Final Workshop</h5>
                <p>
                    Before our final workshop, we did a playtesting workshop with students at the University of Pittsburgh. I collected their feedback on the workshop experience and their opinion on our fabricated poster, persona decks, and the slides.
                    <br>
                    On April 11th, I helped host a playtetsing workshop where we presented refined prototypes and gathered final feedback.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h4 class="handwriting-small">Skills and Tools Demonstrated</h4>
                <ul class="paragraph-list">
                    <li><b>User Research</b>: Co-design facilitation, qualitative data analysis</li>
                    <li><b>Project Management</b>: Timeline coordination, IRB compliance</li>
                    <li><b>Accessibility Design</b>: Accessible communication strategies, assistive-technology use</li>
                    <li><b>Technical Tools</b>: Google Suite</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                <h4 class="handwriting-small">Reflection and Next Steps</h4>
                <p>
                    This project sharpened my ability to blend rigorous research with hands-on facilitation, all while prioritizing accessibility. I learned to iterate communication to create inclusive design outputs. I look forward to using these skills in future UX research and coordination roles, making sure that every project is grounded in the voices of its intended users.
