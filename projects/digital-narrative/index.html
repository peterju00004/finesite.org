                        onestopmoments is a digital narrative I made. As a static site, it demonstrates how interactivity can play a part in the narration and the story. Most information reveals only parts of the story as the user chooses their way through the story by clicking on channels. Some information are carefully hidden that requires the user to figure out where they are located, providing additional complementary details.
                        <br><br>
                        Based on a true story, onestopmoments talks about how a Discord-esque server was created for a group of friends to chill and chat and how it gradually dies over time, as (some) people step into different stages of their life (while the others don't). It essentially talks about how relationships and distances between people can change over time.

                    <p>
                        The Design an Inclusive Spaceship Collaborative Operation (DISCO) is an Open Educational Resource toolkit that uses a playful spaceshipâ€“building metaphor to teach inclusive design principles. As User Testing Coordinator and Research Assistant, I managed outreach to disability organizations, recruited and scheduled participants, and facilitated both remote and in-person co-design sessions. Over twelve weeks, we synthesized the user feedback into actionable design recommendations, and hosted a final playtesting workshop. Through this work, DISCO provides educators and designers with a fun, hands-on way to promote accessibility awareness and real-world inclusive design strategies.
