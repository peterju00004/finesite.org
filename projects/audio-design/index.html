                    <p>
                        Trained classically as a musician, I have experiences in designing audio effects and music for various projects. Kernel Error, being the most recent one, is a horror puzzle-solving game my teammates and I are working on currently. I help with designing its sound effects by the use of Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) and various synthesizers. 
                        <br><br>
                        One key aspects of sound engineering is how the outcome interacts with the narrative and how it represents the story. To me, the synergy is the most important principle about creating sound/audios.
                        <br><br>
                        Besides that, I've also helped with sound design when it comes to micro movies. The selection of background music, the effects, and the voiceover are key to assist the visual storytelling.
                        <br><br>
                        The DAW I use the most is Logic Pro X. Here I have some audio samples/demos for you to listen:

                    <p>Sample 02:</p>
                    <audio controls src="../../assets/02.m4a"></audio>

                <div class="project-subsection">
                    <h4 class="handwriting-small">Songwriting and Production</h4>
                    <p>
                        I have also engaged in songwriting and production, including (re)arranging songs, recording, and mixing them. Genres include pop, rock, jazz, classical music, but I am more than willing to explore different sounds.
                        <br><br>
                        Please contact me if you want to hear some of the demonstrations.

                    <h4 class="handwriting-small">Music Performances</h4>
                    <p>
                        Participated in many bands, I am capable of being the keyboardist, vocalist, and the saxophonist for gigs. I have performed for several jams and occasions including the Spring Festival performances and the CMU Battle of the Bands.
                        <br><br>
                        Currently I am the keyboardist and the saxophonist of a band named Sennight.
